# ScareCrow Wrapper
A wrapper payload for [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) that wraps any agent shellcode with the [ScareCrow](https://github.com/Tylous/ScareCrow) loader. This wrapper currently supports CPL, EXE, and DLL payload types from ScareCrow.

## Usage
In Mythic, go to Create Components > Create Wrapper and then select "scarecrow_wrapper". Select/input the desired configuration options, and then select the payload you would like to wrap. Once the generation is complete, go to Operational Views > Created Payloads to download the output file. The intended filename can be seen in Payload Actions > View Build Message.

## How to install an agent in this format within Mythic

When it's time for you to test out your install or for another user to install your agent, it's pretty simple. Within Mythic you can run the `mythic-cli` binary to install this in one of three ways:

* `sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/user/repo` to install the main branch
* `sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/user/repo branchname` to install a specific branch of that repo
* `sudo ./mythic-cli install folder /path/to/local/folder/cloned/from/github` to install from an already cloned down version of an agent repo

Now, you might be wondering _when_ should you or a user do this to properly add your agent to their Mythic instance. There's no wrong answer here, just depends on your preference. The three options are:

* Mythic is already up and going, then you can run the install script and just direct that agent's containers to start (i.e. `sudo ./mythic-cli start agentName` and if that agent has its own special C2 containers, you'll need to start them too via `sudo ./mythic-cli start c2profileName`).
* Mythic is already up and going, but you want to minimize your steps, you can just install the agent and run `sudo ./mythic-cli start`. That script will first _stop_ all of your containers, then start everything back up again. This will also bring in the new agent you just installed.
* Mythic isn't running, you can install the script and just run `sudo ./mythic-cli start`.
